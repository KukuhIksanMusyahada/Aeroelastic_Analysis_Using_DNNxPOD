## Title
**Development of Surrogate Model Using Deep Learning and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition**
## Problem Statements
- Predict the aerodynamic properties of airfoil NACA 64A010 using **Surrogate Model**
- The surrogate model will utilize **Deep Learning** as a model and **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition** as processing method
- The properties will be predicted are **Lift Coefficient, Drag Coefficient, Plunging Motion, and Pitching Motion**
- The model input should only be the flow characteristic (**mach**) and material characteristic (**flutter speed index**)
- The flight range will be mach 0.6 until mach 0.9
- Flutter speed range is vf 0.4 until vf 2.0
